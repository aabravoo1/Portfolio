# Computer_Architecture
Repository for main computer architecture projects

This repository includes a collaborative project titled MIPS_Final_Proyect and an individual design proyect which consists of a Stack in hardware

## MIPS

Development of a MIPS processor which include R, I, and J type instructions in its ISA
The MIPS was tested with 2 test programs which were developed in machine language utilizing the custom architecture
- Multiplication
- Fibonacci sequence generator

Full description of the project can be found under MIPS_Final_Proyect/Final Project MIPS.pdf

## Individual Design project

This project consists on the investigation and implementation of Stacks in hardware, their functionality, limitations, and relevance in the field.
