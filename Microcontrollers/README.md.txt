## Project description

The project consisted in designing a program for a PIC18F4595 which could serve as a controller for a digital rowing machine.
The rowing machine has the following capabilites:
- ON/Pause switch as well as OFF switch.
- Display the time spent on the machine.
- Display the total amount of rows the user has done.
- Obtain the average amount of rows per minute.
- Set a goal of rows and emit an alarm once this goal has been achieved.
