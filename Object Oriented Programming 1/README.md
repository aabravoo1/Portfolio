The window appears with the game ready to play, a yellow square indicates the food of the snake and the default color for the snake is red
The color of the snake can be changed in the upper right corner, the current points are seen at the top center of the window and the highscore is seen on the upper right corner. The game can be paused by pressing the whitespace key on the keyboard
