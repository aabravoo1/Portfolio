The AVL tree is a self balancing tree, where the differences of heights between branches cannot be greater than 1. 

The project allows for a visual representation of the AVL tree, as well as insertion and deletion of numbers real time.
The data type can also be changed, allowing for an Integer, Double or String tree:
