## Project
This project consists of a binaurial sound generator using an esp32. 
The purpose of the project is to develop a system utilizing FIR filters to transmit real time audio from the microcontroller to the user, the user will then hear the sound given through bluetooth to the microprocessor as if it was rotating 360Â° around their head. 
This project utilizes FIR filters and Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) to achieve this effect.
