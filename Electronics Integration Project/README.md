# Electronics Integration Project
This directory comprises of a project which was done as a part of a course focused on developing an electronics project during the whole semester. 

## Project 
The project consisted of generating a pair of industrial headphone fitted with communication capabilities for in site, real time communication between workers. 
The developed industrial headphones have the following characteristics:
- Real time audio reception and transmition through Wifi
- Selection of audio channel through bluetooth mobile app
- Voice filtering for noise cancelation
- Volume control
