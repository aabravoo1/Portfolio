# Electronics Integration Project
This directory comprises of a project which was done as a part of a course focused on developing an electronics project during the whole semester. 

## Project

The developed industrial headphones have the following characteristics:
- Real time audio reception and transmition through Wifi
- Selection of audio channel through bluetooth mobile app
- Voice filtering for noise cancelation
