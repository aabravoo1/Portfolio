# Digital_Systems

Repository for digital systems projects.
These were implemented on a DE10-Standard Fpga board using Quartus software. 
All projects contain a testbench file to which ensures validation on a pre-si hardware validation software like ModelSim to ensure correct functionality before implementation on FPGA 
All files where developed with the Verilog hardware description language. 

## Lab 7

This lab consists on different projects including: 
- 8 bits full adder
- 8 bits full substractor
- Adder subtractor all in one
- 8 bits multiplier
- Combinational logic barrel shifter

Full description of each of these files can be found in the Laboratorio VII file under the Lab7 directory (in spanish).

## Lab 8 

This lab consists on:
- 8 bits divider
- Binary code to 15 segments decoder
- 32 bits parallel load register
- 32 bits multifunctional register: using a 4 bit selector decide which of the 8 functionalities to execute

Full description of each of these files can be found in the Laboratorio VIII file under the Lab8 directory (in spanish).

## Lab 9

This lab consists on different types of counters: 
- Programmable clock: 1 Hz, 10 Hz, 1 kHz, 10 kHz
- Binary counter
- Binary to BCD counter: counts in ascending or descending order and transforms the outpus to fit in a 7 segment display
- Gray counter
- Johnson counter 
- One hot counter

Full description of each of these files can be found in the Laboratorio IX file under the Lab9 directory (in spanish).

## Lab 10

This lab consists on:
- Led's matrix controller: controller for a 16x16 led matrix which display any message programmed into the controller
- Keylock system: locking system which uses a state machine to only allow access using the correct passcode
- Traffic light control: state machine for an optimized traffic light controller

Full description of each of these files can be found in the Laboratorio X file under the Lab10 directory (in spanish).
